Data journalism Pg Cert final project on parental leave

This is a repository for the data and code I used for my final project at Birmingham City University, Postgraduate Certificate Programme in Data Journalism. The project was an investigation into family leave policies in the developed world. The articles I wrote are available at https://medium.com/p/5d73c88db970/ . 

Folder 1: Origdata

This folder contains the original datasets I used for the project, both for visualizations and linear regression.  

Folder 2: Vizcode

This folder contains the R code I used for three data visualizations in ggplot. 

Folder 3: Regrcode

This folder contains the R code I used for linear regression, in order to determine the factors that influence the length of leave in different countries (visualized in the Shiny app). I collaborated with a statistician, who advised me to use AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) to determine which variables to select.  

Folder 4: Shiny app

This folder contains the R code I used for creating a Shiny app about the factors influencing the length of leave.
